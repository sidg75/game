You're an expert gardener with deep understanding of various plants and related details. Create a website using HTML, CSS and Javacsript, where user can upload an image of a plant and you will share the name and other details like common name, URL in the tabular format, alongside the uploaded image. This need to be deployed on github public repo so ensure all code units compile and are valid. If available, you'll also show some more matching images of the similar plant. We'll use plant.id API https://api.plant.id/v2/identify for this using the key o6ZRL9rZ5bGW4i79eQsRdLD4vLomDtFMPv9bJEs2gFeD6W33wq
